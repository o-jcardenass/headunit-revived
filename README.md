# Transfer branch, not part of the app

This branch carries test briefs and results between the session that writes the code and the agent
that runs it on hardware. Orphan branch: no shared history with `main` or any feature branch, and
nothing here is ever merged.

It is `transfer/rig-rounds`. Until 2026-09-10 it was named after the round it was created for,
`transfer/hotspot-unreadable-config-results-20260807`; links into that name are dead, so cite files
here by path.

## Read this, in this order, and stop there

1. **`TESTING-TEMPLATE.md`**, the standing method. Read it once: capture rules, how to read and
   write `settings.xml`, the app's automation surface, the clean-run protocol, install discipline,
   the four verdicts, and the format results come back in.
2. **`## Queue` below, then your own row in `## Threads`**, found with
   `grep -F '| `<thread>`' README.md`. The row names the one brief to read; it names everything
   else it needs.

**Do not read the other threads' briefs and results.** They are a different fault on a different
build, and several were superseded by later rounds in their own thread. Reading them costs context
and, worse, primes you for a signature that does not apply to the run you are doing. If a brief
needs a prior round, it cites it by filename. Fetch that one, not its neighbours.

The same goes for `archive/`. It is the historical record, not orientation.

Three rules from the template are worth repeating, because breaking any of them invalidates a round:

- **Use the rig's existing scripts.** `hur-wifi-test-scripts/` already has `build_hur.sh`,
  `run_unit_tests.sh` and others. Inventory the folder at the start of every round, use what fits,
  and only add a script when nothing does, leaving it there for next time.
- **Settings are changed in `shared_prefs/settings.xml` with the app stopped**, never through the
  UI, and the settings list is never scrolled with adb.
- **Run the whole round unattended.** Moving between runs, restoring state and deciding that a gated
  run is INCONCLUSIVE are all yours. Escalate only for a failed build gate, a genuinely ambiguous
  fork the brief did not cover, something destructive, or a broken rig.

## Queue

A brief with no results file of the same name. Add a line here when a brief is pushed; delete it
in the commit that pushes the results. Four older briefs have no same-named results because they
were reported under another filename, and are listed so the pairing rule does not re-queue them.

- `zlink-aa-sink-decision-brief.md`, PC only, the descriptor decode and disassembly part two could not run; tools are in `tools/zbt/`
- `audio-focus-round11-brief.md`
- `link-stall-periodic-scan-round4-brief.md` (2.4 GHz plus constrained memory; round 5 ran first and PASSed)
- `video-dropped-frame-keyframe-round7-brief.md` (R1 is a desk check, R2 optional)

Superseded, do not run: `bring-up-status-pill-round1-brief.md` is folded into
`bring-up-status-pill-and-poke-readiness-round1-brief.md` as its Part A, and
`aac-audio-round1-brief.md` into `bring-up-status-pill-and-poke-readiness-round5-brief.md` as its
Part D.

Reported elsewhere, do not run: `bt-auto-start-disconnect-round1-brief.md`,
`wifi-direct-stable-identity-round3-brief.md` and `-round4-brief.md` are all answered by
`wifi-direct-and-bt-auto-start-round1-results.md`; `headunit-reloaded-wireless-wifidirect-brief.md`
by `bssid-round1-results.md` and its addendum.

| `external-bt-zbt` / `zlink-wpp-channel` | **IN FLIGHT** | external-bt-tcp-link-findings.md; candidate b64912805, 8 commits on main. Pending: speak-first fallback, Type 4/1 retransmits, daemon-reachability gate, rmnet* exclusion from soft-AP pick. |
| `zlink-media-usb-and-carlink` | **DONE** | zlink-media-usb-and-carlink-results.md; PC-only. AA sink can announce AAC (runtime `get_is_AA_AAC_audiotype`); no video branch on `CHANNELS_24GHZ_ONLY`; no BT link action after `AA_wait_port ok`. Wired AA = libusb AOA; wired CarPlay = USB-gadget NCM + libusbmuxd; no Android USB filter. CarLink = BLE-GATT mode, disjoint from AA. Descriptor decode blocked (script absent). Response: zlink-media-usb-and-carlink-response.md (Q4's AP-host line corrected: the vendor head unit hosts the SoftAP). |
| `zlink-aa-sink-decision` | **QUEUED** | zlink-aa-sink-decision-brief.md; PC-only, part three: descriptor decode plus disassembly of `get_is_AA_AAC_audiotype`, `max_unacked` and the offered video list. Scripts shipped in `tools/zbt/`. |
| `aac-audio` | **IN FLIGHT** | round 7 brief queued. Round 6: F2 PASS clean on a second decoder vendor; F1's band detection, AAC announce and 720p30 cap PASS, its decoder-start condition unreachable. Round 7 redoes it, adds F1b (cap off, same forced band) and still owes F3. |
| `qf001-firmware-teardown` | **DONE** | qf001-firmware-teardown-results.md; answered. Nothing queued. |
| `headunit-reloaded-decompile` | **CLOSED** | headunit-reloaded-decompile-findings.md; PC-only decompile comparison, no rig time. Nothing copied; their Native AA wireless path closely matches ours. |
| `gemini-research-video-optimization` | **CLOSED** | gemini-research-video-optimization-findings.md; PC-only fact-check, no rig time. Two open items: KEY_LOW_LATENCY and AudioTrack low-latency mode. |
| `logcat-access-android13` | **CLOSED** | logcat-access-android13-findings.md; PC-only research, no rig time. Fix landed on fix/log-and-selfmode-fixes (809adff3, a5cd6fc8). |
| `native-aa-poke-hardening` | **DONE** | native-aa-poke-hardening-results.md; answered. Nothing queued. |
| `video-latency` | **DONE** | video-latency-round1-results.md; answered at round 1. Nothing queued. |
| `hotspot-unreadable-config` | **CLOSED** | No dedicated brief; this is the origin round the transfer branch was created for, now historical. |
| `p2p-bringup-loop` | **DONE** | p2p-bringup-loop-round1-results.md; round 1 PASS, regression-clean, ships. Nothing queued. |
| `wpp-over-tcp` | **DONE** | wpp-over-tcp-round5-results.md; PR-ready at aa54e6e9, ping-count question resolved. No further round needed. |
| `bring-up-status-pill-and-poke-readiness` | **IN FLIGHT** | round9-brief.md queued against `a8917a7a`, gate 1831/0. Two things: A2b's fix (A2 as its control, A2b, and A2e's two recreations), and the first hardware run of the auto-start offer now that it is asked at the session's first frame instead of on the home screen (Part O, five runs). Round 8's only FAIL was A2b and it is fixed; everything else there PASSed, including all six of C1-C6 and F1's condition 3. |
| `bring-up-status-pill-and-poke-readiness (round 7)` | **DONE** | round 7 no FAIL: R1/A1/A3/B2/C1-C5/E5 PASS and the offer's ASK arm reached the screen at last. Three defects found, all fixed on `e466171a`. See round7-results.md. |

Round files are `<thread>-round<N>-brief.md` and `<thread>-round<N>-results.md`. A brief with no
matching results file is a round nobody has run yet. That pairing is the only queue there is, so
keep the names regular.

## Keeping this file lean

This README was 1,137 lines on 2026-08-14 and a tester agent read all of it before every round;
that history is in `archive/rounds-log-through-2026-08-14.md`. By 2026-09-10 it had grown back to
171 KB in 67 table rows averaging 2,450 characters, about 43,000 tokens read at the start of every
round. The rows as they stood are in `archive/threads-table-through-2026-09-10.md`; the table above
is what they condensed to, under 300 characters a row.

So, for whoever writes the next brief: **the outcome of a round goes in its own results file and
the table above, not into a narrative here.** One row, one state, one filename, and a Queue line
while the brief is unrun. The State cell is one of **QUEUED**, **IN FLIGHT**, **DONE**, **MERGED**,
**CLOSED**. If the state needs a sentence of context, it belongs in the next brief, where the
person who needs it is already reading. A row over 300 characters is the signal this file is
growing back.
